/**
* If you need to make small adjustments or additions to the CSS for a Fabrik
* list template, you can create a custom_css.php file, which will be loaded after
* the main template_css.php for the template.
*
* This file will be invoked as a PHP file, so the list ID
* can be used in order to narrow the scope of any style changes.  You do
* this by prepending #listform_$c to any selectors you use.  This will become
* (say) #listform_12, owhich will be the HTML ID of your list on the page.
*
* See examples below, which you should remove if you copy this file.
*
* Don't edit anything outside of the BEGIN and END comments.
*
* For more on custom CSS, see the Wiki at:
*
* http://fabrikar.com/wiki/index.php/3.x_Form_Templates#Custom_CSS
