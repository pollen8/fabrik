/**
 * If you need to make small adjustments or additions to the CSS for a Fabrik
 * template, you can create a custom_css.php file, which will be loaded after
 * the main template_css.php for the template.
 *
 * This file will be invoked as a PHP file, so the view type and form ID
 * can be used in order to narrow the scope of any style changes.  You do
 * this by prepending #{$view}_$c to any selectors you use.  This will become
 * (say) #form_12, or #details_11, which will be the HTML ID of your form
 * on the page.
 *
 * See examples below, which you should remove if you copy this file.
 *
 * Don't edit anything outside of the BEGIN and END comments.
 *
 * For more on custom CSS, see the Wiki at:
 *
 * http://www.fabrikar.com/forums/index.php?wiki/form-and-details-templates/#the-custom-css-file
 *
 * NOTE - for backward compatibility with Fabrik 2.1, and in case you
 * just prefer a simpler CSS file, without the added PHP parsing that
 * allows you to be be more specific in your selectors, we will also include
 * a custom.css we find in the same location as this file.
