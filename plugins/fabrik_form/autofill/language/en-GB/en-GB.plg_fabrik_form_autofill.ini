e.g. {"_QQ_"acts___name"_QQ_":"_QQ_"events___title"_QQ_","_QQ_"acts___bio"_QQ_":"_QQ_"events___description"_QQ_"}
Looks up artist, and puts the artist name in the events title, and the artist bio and puts it in the forms 'events___description' field.

To map a single 'from' to multiple 'to' elements, use an array from the 'to' value, like ["_QQ_"table___field1"_QQ_","_QQ_"table___field2"_QQ_"]

Join records are now mapped with the full name(previously you had to append the full element name wth 'join__X____', and whilst this will still work it is no longer necessary
