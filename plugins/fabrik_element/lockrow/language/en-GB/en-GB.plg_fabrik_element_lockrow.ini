PLG_ELEMENT_LOCKROW_TTL_DESC="Time to Live, in minutes.  Time after which a locked row will become unlocked and editable again.

'Exclusive' means that the user can open a second or subsequent form on the same record, but only the last one opened can be submitted.  'No' means that if the user has a lock on the row, they will not be able to open it for editing, they will first have to unlock it (either by submitting an open form, unlocking in list view, or wait for the lock to time out)."
PLG_ELEMENT_LOCKROW_ALLOW_USER_REEDIT_LABEL="Allow Re-Edit"
PLG_ELEMENT_LOCKROW_NOTE="This element allows automatic locking of a row when being edited, so nobody else can edit it.  It automatically unlocks on form submission, or when the lock times out.  It requires the lockrow list plugin to be installed, to implement the access control.  The element has no visible display in form or details view.  If included in list view, it will display a padlock icon, locked or unlocked, which can be used to unlock the row"

PLG_ELEMENT_LOCKROW_RELOCKED_MSG="You already had a lock on this record for editing.  The record has been re-locked, but if you have it open in another browser tab, you will still be able to submit it from there.  NOTE that this can cause data loss, if you submit multiple forms for the same record, as subsequent submits will overwrite data."
PLG_ELEMENT_LOCKROW_OWN_LOCKED_MSG="You already have a lock on this record, probably because you have previously edited it and haven't submitted it, so you cannot edit it until the lock is released.  You must either submit the open copy of the form (if it exists), unlock this record in the list view (if your admin allows this), or you must wait till the lock times out in %s minutes"
PLG_ELEMENT_LOCKROW_LOCK_EXPIRED_MSG="This record had an expired lock, probably because someone edited it, didn't submit it, and the lock has expired.  The record has now been re-locked for you.  Any other forms open for this record can no longer be submitted."
PLG_ELEMENT_LOCKROW_LOCK_LOCKING_MSG="This record is being locked for your use.  Nobody else can edit this record till you submit it.  The record will stay locked for %s minutes.
